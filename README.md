# Casper

The default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/).

To download, visit the [releases](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases) page.

## With - Nav

This is the smaller modification I could bring to add a simple navigation without
fiddling too much with casper source code.

To add items to the menu, you have to create a post, and make it a "Static Page".
Then you have to modify the [partials/menu.hbs](partials/menu.hbs) file, and add the exact slug it
was previously created.

That's it, enjoy your ghost with navigation powered theme :P.
